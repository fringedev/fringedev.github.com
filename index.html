            <h2>What's this?</h2>
            <p>First of all, this is not your day job kind of stuff!</p>
            <p>No, it's about that curiosity that brings you to Hacker News every hour,
            looking for another juicy functional programming piece of intel. It's about dropping
            the silent "<i>but</i>" at the end of your "<i>I've always wanted to check out graph databases</i>" line.
            About taking the time to appreciate the tools that take us there, when day in, day out we're too busy worrying about the end product.
            </p>
            <p>And most importantly, it's about sharing our passion for novelty with our fellow hackers, exploring together
            the fringe of software dev.

            <h2>Inspiring! But... what is it?</h2>
            <p>We're leaving that a bit open ended for now by calling it a "<i>happening</i>" that brings Montreal hackers together.
            It's not an organization, a user group, or an event, but in a way it's a bit of all. We're planning on holding
            regular meetups throughout the year, as well as special events like hackathons, workshops and unconferences.
            Some of the tech we'll look at may already be gathering a small Montreal user group, so we'll work with them
            to bring more exposure to the things they do. And it's all organized by a very open group of people, for which
            the only admission requirement is a willingness to make this happening awesomer and awesomer.

            <h2>Okay then, so how? when? where?</h2>
            <p>This is all still very early stage. This Fall we hope to be ready with our first 1.0-public-release kind of
            event, but until then we're meeting in social settings to get to know each other better and prepare what Fringe
            Dev is to become. If you want to come hang out with us and be a part of the conversation, the best way to
            reach out would be on Twitter, at <a href="http://twitter.com/FringeDev" target="_blank">@FringeDev</a>.

            <p>There is much more to be said about the things we're planning and about the philosophy we're going for,
            but then there wouldn't be any content left for this blog we're about to set up.
            So meanwhile, hope to see you soon and happy hacking!
